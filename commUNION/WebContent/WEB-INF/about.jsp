		<p> As corporations have amassed more power, it has become increasingly harder for workers to speak their mind on conditions they do not agree with in their respective workplaces whether be it safety related, compensation, or overall work condition improvement.
		commUNION was created to act as a safe medium of expression, where multiple individuals can come together and seek answers to issues that plague them in the workplace. 
		Our goal is to build a vast network of experienced union reps that can share their expertise with anyone seeking help with work related issues and in turn build a library of defined solutions that users can look into to find similar cases
